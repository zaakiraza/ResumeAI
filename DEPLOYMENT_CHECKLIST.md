## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project/settings/environment-variables
2. Add these variables for **Production**:
   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api
   VITE_FRONTEND_URL=https://resume-frontend-ruby.vercel.app/
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

Or use Vercel Git integration (automatic):
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically deploy

### Step 3: Test Backend Endpoints
Test each new endpoint with curl or Postman:

**1. Proofread Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api/ai-tools/proofread \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"text": "I has an error in this sentance."}'
```

**2. Rewrite Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api/ai-tools/rewrite \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"text": "Make this formal", "tone": "more-formal"}'
```

**3. Summarize Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api/ai-tools/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"text": "Long text here...", "length": "short"}'
```

**4. Interview Questions Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api/ai-tools/interview-questions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
    "skills": ["React", "Node.js"],
    "experience": "3 years",
    "count": 5
  }'
```

**5. Answer Suggestion Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://resume-backend-roan-nu.vercel.app/api/ai-tools/answer-suggestion \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "question": "Tell me about a challenging project",
    "jobTitle": "Software Engineer",
    "skills": ["React", "Node.js"],
    "experience": "3 years"
  }'
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend Features

**In Chrome Canary (Chrome AI Testing):**
1. Open Chrome Canary (v144+)
2. Visit chrome://components/
3. Download "Optimization Guide On Device Model"
4. Visit your app: https://resume-frontend-ruby.vercel.app/
5. Test proofreading - Should see "🚀 Chrome AI" badge
6. Check console - Should see "✅ Using Chrome Proofreader API"
7. Performance should be instant (~100-300ms)

**In Regular Chrome (OpenAI Fallback Testing):**
1. Open Chrome/Edge/Safari
2. Visit your app: https://resume-frontend-ruby.vercel.app/
3. Test proofreading - Should see "🌐 Cloud AI" badge
4. Check console - Should see "🌐 Using OpenAI API"
5. Performance should be 2-3 seconds
6. Test all 5 features work correctly

**Test Authentication:**
1. Try without login - Should redirect to login
2. Login with valid credentials
3. Test AI features - Should work
4. Logout and try again - Should redirect to login

### Step 5: Monitor Performance

**Chrome DevTools Network Tab:**
- Check API calls to backend
- Verify Bearer token is sent
- Check response times
- Verify no 401/403 errors

**Console Logs:**
- Look for "✅ Using Chrome..." or "🌐 Using OpenAI..."
- Check for any error messages
- Verify no CORS errors

**Backend Logs (Vercel Dashboard):**
- Monitor OpenAI API usage
- Check for any 500 errors
- Verify authentication is working
